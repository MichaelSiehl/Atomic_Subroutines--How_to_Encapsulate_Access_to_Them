# Atomic_Subroutines--How_to_Encapsulate_Access_to_Them
Fortran 2008 coarray programming with unordered execution segments (user-defined ordering) - Atomic Subroutines: Encapsulate access to atomic_define and atomic_ref

# Overview
This GitHub repository aims to show how to encapsulate access to the both Fortran 2008 atomic subroutines atomic_define and atomic_ref and thus, how to keep the parallel logic codes and syntax apart from the application's main logic codes.
